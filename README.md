✈️ Flight Price Prediction Project — Business Case

In the rapidly growing aviation industry, airfare pricing is highly dynamic, influenced by multiple factors such as demand, seasonality, flight duration, and airline competition. Predicting flight ticket prices accurately helps both travelers and airline companies make smarter decisions. For businesses, optimized pricing strategies drive higher revenue, while for customers, accurate fare forecasts enable better budget planning and timely bookings.

🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based Flight Price Prediction system that:

Analyzes flight details and travel patterns to estimate airfare trends.

Identifies key factors influencing ticket prices.

Predicts flight fares with high accuracy using advanced ML models.

Provides actionable insights for dynamic pricing, travel planning, and market analysis.

🧩 Aim of the Project

Build an end-to-end predictive model to estimate flight prices using structured flight data.

Perform comprehensive EDA to uncover hidden patterns and influential features.

Engineer meaningful features such as journey duration, departure time, and total stops.

Implement and compare multiple regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

🌟 Key Highlights

✨ Conducted detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand pricing variations across airlines and routes.
✨ Extracted time-based and categorical features to enhance model interpretability.
✨ Built multiple regression models and selected the best-performing algorithm based on RMSE and R² metrics.
✨ Visualized fare patterns across airlines, routes, and flight duration using Python libraries.
✨ Delivered data-driven insights for cost-effective travel planning and market analysis.
